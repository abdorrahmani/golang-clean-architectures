## Overview
**golang-clean-architectures** is a repository that showcases various architecture patterns commonly used in Golang projects. Each folder in this repository demonstrates an independent architecture style, enabling developers to explore, learn, and implement them in real-world projects.

### Current Architectures
- **Feature-Based Architecture**:
    - The first implementation in this repository.
    - Organizes the codebase by features to improve modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
    - Includes a fully functional project with JWT-based authentication, user registration, and post management.

### Future Architectures (Coming Soon)
- **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters)
- **Clean Architecture**
- **Layered Architecture**
- **Microservices Architecture**

Each implementation will include:
- A fully functional project.
- Documentation explaining the architecture.
- A practical use case.

## Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdorrahmani/golang-clean-architectures.git
cd golang-clean-architectures
```

### Explore Architectures
Navigate to the folder of the architecture you want to explore. For example, to explore the Feature-Based Architecture:
```bash
cd Feature-Based
```
Follow the specific `README.md` in the folder for detailed setup instructions.

## Feature-Based Architecture
The **Feature-Based Architecture** is included in the `Feature-Based` folder. It demonstrates:
- Organizing code by feature.
- Using Docker Compose for containerization.
- Implementing modular design principles.

Learn more in the [Feature-Based README](Feature-Based/README.md).
